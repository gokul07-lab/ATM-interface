 Java ATM Interface ‚Äì Project Overview
 Project Title:
ATM Interface Simulation using Java

 Description:
The ATM Interface project is a console-based Java application that simulates basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides a user-friendly menu system that allows the user to perform essential banking operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and exiting the session securely.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Basic login using PIN or account number (optional in simple versions).

Menu-Driven Interface: Displays a list of options for the user to choose from.

Balance Inquiry: Allows the user to check their current account balance.

Deposit Functionality: Lets the user deposit money into the account.

Withdrawal Functionality: Lets the user withdraw money with balance check.

Exit Option: Ends the session cleanly.

Input Validation: Checks for invalid options and insufficient balance.

üß† How It Works:
The program starts with a welcome message and optional login step.

A menu is shown with numbered choices (e.g., 1. Check Balance, 2. Withdraw, 3. Deposit, 4. Exit).

Based on the user‚Äôs choice, the corresponding function is executed.

The program loops until the user selects "Exit".

Displays confirmation messages after each transaction.
